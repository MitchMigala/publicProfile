                    Worked directly with marketing, writing custom software that allowed
                    them to more narrowly target their ads increasing return on marketing spending.
                    Implemented regular back-ups of databases using a hard-drive array. Was working
                    on using regular expressions to eliminate cross-scripting in web forms to elminate code 
                    injection, when I left the company. I also helped with regular IT support help.
